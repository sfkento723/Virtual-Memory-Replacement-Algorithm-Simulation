# Virtual-Memory-Replacement-Algorithm-Simulation
This is a virtual memory replacement algorithm simulator written in C++. This was originally a project for an Operating Systems class I took in university.
Included is my source code for the program and a modified version of a report submitted detailing and documenting my approach, along with instructions for execution; minor edits were made to preserve the privacy of my instructor.

This program makes use of the Boost library; please make sure that the library is installed when running this program.
